# Some different types of Sensors ->
### Environmental Sensors

1. Temperature sensors: Measure temperature changes (e.g., thermistors, thermocouples).
2. Humidity sensors: Measure humidity levels (e.g., capacitive, resistive).
3. Air quality sensors: Detect pollutants and gases (e.g., particulate matter, NO2, CO2).
4. Light sensors: Measure light intensity and color (e.g., photodiodes, phototransistors).
5. Noise sensors: Measure sound levels and frequency (e.g., microphones).

### Motion and Position Sensors

1. Accelerometers: Measure acceleration, vibration, and orientation (e.g., MEMS accelerometers).
2. Gyroscopes: Measure orientation, rotation, and angular velocity (e.g., MEMS gyroscopes).
3. Magnetometers: Measure magnetic fields and orientation (e.g., Hall effect sensors).
4. Proximity sensors: Detect nearby objects (e.g., infrared, ultrasonic).
5. GPS sensors: Provide location information (e.g., GPS modules).

### Pressure and Force Sensors

1. Pressure sensors: Measure pressure changes (e.g., piezoresistive, capacitive).
2. Force sensors: Measure applied forces (e.g., strain gauges, load cells).

### Chemical and Gas Sensors

1. pH sensors: Measure acidity and alkalinity (e.g., pH electrodes).
2. Gas sensors: Detect specific gases (e.g., CO, NO2, O3).
3. Moisture sensors: Measure moisture levels (e.g., capacitive, resistive).

### Biometric Sensors

1. Fingerprint sensors: Authenticate users (e.g., capacitive, optical).
2. Heart rate sensors: Measure heart rate and rhythm (e.g., photoplethysmography).
3. Blood oxygen level sensors: Measure blood oxygen levels (e.g., pulse oximetry).

### Image and Vision Sensors

1. Cameras: Capture images and video (e.g., visible light, infrared).
2. Object detection sensors: Detect objects and track movement (e.g., computer vision algorithms).
